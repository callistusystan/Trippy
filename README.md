# Trippy

This project won <strong>FIRST PLACE</strong> for the Facebook Melbourne Hack in 2018.


The concept is an real-time platform for family or a groups of friends to plan a trip! It lists all the flights, accommodations, eateries, landmarks, car rentals which are populated using Facebook Graph API, Google Places API, Yelp and Zomato. These come with details like ratings, costs, photos and user reviews. 

Users vote for which item is their favourites and an itineray is created based on top picks. This helps users get a better understanding on their favourite places to visit during their trip. Users also have access to a chat feature to communicate while using the app.


This project was made with React, Redux, Python and Firebase
